# gocrawler
A very simple Go based html links crawler. It starts with a given web link and then crawls through the weblinks referenced in it, gathering them.

It does not yet do anything fancy or useful with the index pages. This is work in progress for now; useful for anyone trying to 
get started with crawling weblinks using Golang
